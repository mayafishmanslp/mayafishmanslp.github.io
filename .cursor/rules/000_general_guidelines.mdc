These are general guidelines to follow during the development of Maya Fishman SLP Web page.

Given these guidelines:
- Take your time to think through problems and solutions thoroughly. Quality is more important than speed.
- Follow instructions precisely and execute them perfectly. If anything is unclear, ask for clarification.
- Write code that is easy to understand and maintain. Prioritize readability over brevity.
- For complex tasks, suggest breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps to implement incrementally.
- Practice modularity by moving code into separate files when a file becomes too large or handles multiple responsibilities. This helps prevent code from becoming disorganized and hard to manage.
- Whenever there is a significant change that should be recorded, update a changelog.txt file inside the maya-fishman/docs dir
